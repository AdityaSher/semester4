/Q: Study basic file structure of Linux/ Unix system.

Unix file system is used to organize and store large amounts of information in a way that makes it easy to manage.

Unix interacts with the data and hardware! in two formats only, either a file or a process.

Data is stored in files in linux, which are in turn stored in directories, these directories form a tree like structure.

The top level directory or root is called as root ( represented by a "/" ) which self justifies its name and purpose!

All other files are children directories or descendents of root!

**The directory structure can be reprsented as below**
(each new column of arrow -> indicates a new level 
eg. cp is child of bin)


/ (root)-> bin  ->cp
		->ksh
		->is
		->pwd		
	-> dev
	-> etc
		->passwd
	-> home
		->mthomas
			->bin
			->class stuff
				->foo
				->bar
			->profile
		->stul
	-> lib
	-> mnt
	-> proc
	-> root
	-> sbin
	-> tmp
	-> usr
		->bin


/   = denotes root of file system tree

/bin = "binaries" , contains fundamental utilities such as ls or cp (copy), which are generally needed by all users.

/boot= files required for booting process

/dev= devices,file representations of peripherals and pseudo-devices

/etc= Contains system-wide confirguration file and system databases.

/home = home directory for users

/lib = contains system libraries, and critical files such as kernel modules.

/media = default mount point for removable devices, such as USB sticks, media players, etc.

/mnt = mount, filesystem mopuntpoints, used if system has multiple HDD or HDD partitions, also used for filesystems, CD-ROM/DVD drives and so on.

/proc = virtual file system, info about processes as files.

/root = home for superuser "/root" 

/tmp = place for temporary files, cleared upon startup

/usr = holds executables, libraries and shared resources

/usr/bin= binary files residing in operating system which are not at /bin or /sbin

/usr/include= development headers used throughout the system, header files are mostly used by #include directives in c

/usr/lib= stores libraries and data files

/var = place for files that change often

/var/log= system log files

/var/mail= stores mails

/var/spool= print jobs, mail spools, and other queue tasks

/var/tmp: temp files which must be preserved after reboot.



**Types of uni9x files**

Ordinary Files
Directories
Special Files
Pipes
Sockets
Symbolic Links
 

    ls=> used to view directory structure
	cd=> used to navigate /enter directory (special case: cd .. goes to parent directory)
	mkdir => create new directory
	rmdir => remove directory
	touch "filename.extension" => create new file
	

Q2	

sed -e ''$2'd' $1

Q3

for i in ./*
	do
		file=$(echo $i | tr '[:upper:] [:lower:]' '[:lower:] [:upper:]')
		mv $i $file
done

Q4

file=$1
if [ -e ${file} ]
then
    cat "${$1}" >> "${$2}"
else
    echo "File does not exist"
fi
